we apply factor-investing principles to four factors-value,small capitalization(size),high momentum, and low risk-
using country index funds instead of individual stocks to produce a better risk-return trade-off than the 
capitalization-weighted world market portfolio.

we used country dollar total return indexes from MSCI for 23 developed markets and 21 emerging markets.
Either ETFs or futures contracts exist for all markets.

For the world market portifolio, we used the MSCI All-Country World Index(ACWI).

to construct the global value portfolios, we ranked all countries by a composite valuation indicator combining a country's
price-to-earnings, price-to-book, and price-to-cash-flow ratios along with dividend yield.

we formed three portofolios, each containing one-third of the 44 countries, and calculated the monthly returns over the
next 12 months.

small-cap portfolio; high-momentum; low-beta 

in the first stage of factor portfolio construction process, we chose the countries with the highest factor exposure.

in the second stage, our objective in the single- and multifactor portfolio construction process was to create mean-
variance-efficient factor portifolio in the presence of estimation risk.

we created factor portfolios using:
1, capitalization weights-equal(EW)
2, inverse variance(IV)
3, minimum variance(MinVar)
4,maximum diversification portfolio(MDP) weights


capitalization weighting(CW) is the most commonly used index construction methodology, despite its well-known shortcomings
of excessive concentration and inferior risk-adjusted performance
