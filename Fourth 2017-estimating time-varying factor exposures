we decomposed the active returns into three components:
1, returns to static factor exposures, such as a constant tilt to such factors as value and momentum
2, factor timing, whereby(by means of which) the factor exposures vary over time
3, security selection, which reflects the returns in excess of a factor model of individual securities
